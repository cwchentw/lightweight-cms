# Theme(s) of mdcms.

## For End Users

This directory places the theme(s) of mdcms. If you want to establish a new theme or modify current theme, don't modify anything in *default* theme directly. Instead, copy *default* directory to a new one. Alter your own theme over there. Remember to alter **SITE_THEME** the variable in *setting.php*.

## For Theme Creators

Create an independent repo for your own theme. You may copy *default* theme as a template. Later, integrate your theme into mdcms as a Git submodule. If you alter the main repo of mdcms, your modifications will be rejected.
