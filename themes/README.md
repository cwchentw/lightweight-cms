# Themes for Lightweight CMS

## For End Users

This directory places themes of Lightweight CMS. If you want to establish a new theme or modify current theme, don't change anything here directly. Instead, copy the directory of the theme template to a new location. Edit it over there. Remember to alter **SITE_THEME** the variable in your configuration file accordingly.

## For Theme Creators

Create an independent repo for your own Lightweight CMS theme. You may either copy one theme here as your boilerplate project or write everything from scratch. Later, integrate your theme into Lightweight CMS as a Git submodule. If you alter anything here directly, your modification will be rejected unless there is some compelling reason.
