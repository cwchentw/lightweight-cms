# Theme(s) for mdcms

## For End Users

This directory places the theme(s) of mdcms. If you want to establish a new theme or modify current theme, don't change anything in *default* theme directly. Instead, copy *default* directory to a new location. Edit it over there. Remember to alter **SITE_THEME** the variable in *setting.php*.

## For Theme Creators

Create an independent repo for your own theme. You may either copy *default* theme as a template or write everything from scratch. Later, integrate your theme into mdcms as a Git submodule. If you alter the main theme of mdcms directly, your modifications will be rejected unless there is some compelling reason.
