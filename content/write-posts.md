# Write Posts on mdcms

## Prologue

As a future owner of an awesome content website, you cannot wait to write posts. This article illustrates how to write posts on mdcms-based sites.

## Choose an Programming Editor

Markdowns represents a simple and lightweight markup language without programming logic. Any programming editor will suffice. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), a free and cross-platform editor, is popular among programmers and suitable for Markdown as well.

## Write a Markdown Post

The feature set of original Markdown is limited. There are several variants of Markdown extending the capacity of this small markup language. The Markdown dialect supported by mdcms is [GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) (GFM), which is used on the online editor of GitHub.

Because of limited page size, we won't repeat the syntax of GFM here. Refer to its official spec for more.
