## Prologue

Most PHP-powered sites run on GNU/Linux. mdcms sites are of no exception. Nevertheless, some web programmers prefer Windows during development stage. This article illustrates steps to run mdcms on Windows.

## System Requirements

* Production environment
  * A web server like Apache or Nginx
  * PHP 7.2 or above
  * FastCGI Process Manager (FPM) of PHP
  * [FrontYAML](https://github.com/mnapoli/FrontYAML)
  * (Optional) Perl (for global replacement)
* Development environment
  * [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
  * [PHP Code Sniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) (for linting)
  * [PHPMD](https://phpmd.org/) (for linting)

If you are not interested in developing mdcms itself, you still require Composer to install other dependency packages for mdcms.

### Front End

* Production environment
  * A [modern browser](https://browsehappy.com/) like Chrome and Firefox
  * [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)
  * [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/)
  * [Bootstrap.Native](https://thednp.github.io/bootstrap.native/)
  * (Optional) [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/)
* Development environment
  * Node.js
  * [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/)
  * [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
  * [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)
  * [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/)
  * [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
  * [Flow](https://flow.org/en/)
  * [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

These dependencies are for *default* theme of mdcms. If you utilize another mdcms theme, your dependencies may vary.

Currently, we utilize Sass as CSS preprocessor and Babel with Flow as JavaScript transcompiler. If you prefer other front end stacks over our choices, you may completely remove those, adding your own. They are independent of mdcms itself.

## Build a Development Environment for mdcms

### Install Command-Line Tools

Install [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org) first, which is a package manager for Windows used to install other software.

Install PHP:

```shell
> choco install php --version=7.4.20
```

At time of our writing, many GNU/Linux distributions still provide PHP 7 rather than PHP 8. Therefore, we install PHP 7 intentionally.

Install Composer, a package manager for PHP:

```shell
> choco install composer
```

Install `rsync(1)` for Windows:

```shell
> choco install rsync
```

(Optional) Install Perl from either [ActivePerl](https://www.activestate.com/products/perl/) or [Strawberry Perl](https://strawberryperl.com/).

### Install Laragon

Download installer of Laragon from its [official website](https://laragon.org). Doubly click the installer to install Laragon.

Select the lauguage shown during installation:

Select destination location to install Laragon:

<p><img src="/img/howto/laragon-select-destination-location.png" alt="Select destination location to install Laragon" class="img-fluid" /></p>

Select additional settings if needed:

<p><img src="/img/howto/laragon-select-additional-settings.png" alt="Select additional settings to install Laragon" class="img-fluid" /></p>

We don't need these settings. Therefore, we unselect all.

Check all settings before install Laragon:

<p><img src="/img/howto/laragon-ready-to-install.png" alt="Select additional settings to install Laragon" class="img-fluid" /></p>

The installation is done:

<p><img src="/img/howto/laragon-completing-setup-wizard.png" alt="Select additional settings to install Laragon" class="img-fluid" /></p>

Enable required services:

<p><img src="/img/howto/laragon-set-services-and-ports.png" alt="Select additional settings to install Laragon" class="img-fluid" /></p>

We substitute Apache with Nginx here. If you don't need MySQL now, disable it temporarily.

You may encounter some warning from Windows Defender (a builtin firewall for Windows):

<p><img src="/img/howto/laragon-windows-defender-nginx.png" alt="Select additional settings to install Laragon" class="img-fluid" /></p>

Simply enable it. We don't use Laragon on production environments, stopping all services after development.

Set your Nginx configuration accordingly. [Here](https://github.com/cwchentw/mdcms/blob/master/tools/etc/windows/nginx.conf) is a sample configuration.

## Usage

Clone mdcms locally and rename it:

```shell
> git clone https://github.com/cwchentw/mdcms.git mysite
```

Change working directory to root path of the cloned repo:

```shell
> cd mysite
```

Install dependencies for mdcms:

```shell
> composer install --no-dev
```

Development tools like PHP Code Sniffer mean to lint code, which are not required to run mdcms.

If you don't want to update your mdcms snapshot, you may safely remove all sample posts in *content* directory but not the directory itself, adding your awesome ones.

Instead, if you are going to update your mdcms copy, follow [this guide](/howto/how-to-upgrade-mdcms/).

You can run a mdcms site locally with builtin web server of PHP:

```
$ .\tools\bin\serve.bat
```

Alternatively, if you want to simulate a production environment, copy your mdcms snapshot to Laragon document directory:

```shell
> .\tools\bin\sync-to.bat C:\Laragon\www\mdcms
```

If you alter anything in your mdcms site, repeat the above command to reflect your change on development environment.

(Optional) Save your mdcms repo to a remote site:

```shell
> git remote set-url origin https://example.com/user/mysite.git
> git push -u origin master
```
