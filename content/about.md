# About mdcms

[mdcms (Markdown Content Management System)](https://github.com/cwchentw/mdcms) represents a Markdown-based dynamic website generator powered by PHP.

Unlike static website generators, the HTML pages in mdcms-based websites are rendered dynamically, just like all PHP-powered sites. Nonetheless, the sites in mdcms doesn't rely on any relational database for content storage. Instead, contents in such sites are stored as flat Markdown files.

The website itself is a live demonstration of mdcms, powered by a classical combination of GNU/Linux, Nginx and PHP.
